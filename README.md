Python-Employee-Data-Exploration

Overview:
This project analyzes employee data using a synthetic dataset of 101 employee records. The dataset includes information such as employee age, salary, and department. The analysis aims to explore relationships between employee characteristics and salary and is intended for educational and demonstration purposes.

Dataset
The dataset, named `employees_dataset.csv`, contains the following attributes:

- `Employee_ID`: Unique identifier for each employee.
- `Name`: Employee's name.
- `Age`: Employee's age.
- `Salary`: Employee's salary.
- `Department`: The department in which the employee works.

TO USE THIS:

To use this dataset and analyze it, follow these steps:

1. Clone the Repository: Clone this GitHub repository to your local machine using the following command:
2. Install Dependencies: Ensure you have Python and the required libraries (e.g., Pandas, NumPy, SciPy) installed on your system.
3. Run the Analysis: Execute the analysis script by running the `employees_analysis.py` file. This script reads the dataset, performs statistical analysis, and provides insights into the data.
4. Interpret Results: The analysis will generate results that provide insights into the dataset. Check the terminal for the output.


Permission: After finishing my python course at university, I attempted to create a little structer of everything I had learnt there and prior.
Because I couldn't disclose my primary project, this one may be a synopsis of it.
